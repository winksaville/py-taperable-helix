    Returns a pure function. This returned function has one parameter,
    an inclusive value between first_t and last_t which represents the
    relative helix height. The returned value is the corresponding
    point on the helix and is returned as a tuple(x, y, z).

    A helix can be as simple as a single line or be a set of helical "wires"
    which define a "solid" that can start at a point and the smoothly expand
    to the desired "solid" and then smoothly taper back to a point.

    The nomial use case is to create triangular or trapazoidal threads
    for nuts and bolts. This is accomplished by invoking helix
    multiple times with the same radius, pitch, cvrg_factor, inset_offset,
    first_t, and last_t but with differing values for  horz_offset and
    vert_offset. The returned functions are then invoked over with the desired
    values and the returned points will all start at the same point then
    expand to the sectional shape and then all taper back to the ending point.

    Nomially the helix begins on the xy plane with specified radius, pitch
    and height. The additional parameters, cvrg_factor and xxx_offset values
    modify the helixes shape. The first_t and last_t define the inclusive
    range of values passed as the "t" parameter to the returned function.

    The default values of first_t and last_t are 0 and 1. If first_t == last_t
    then it is assumed the returned function will only be invoked with value
    defined values in the inclusive range of first_t to last_t. The expression,
    rel_t = t / (last_t - first_t), defines the relative t value which is used
    to define the location of where tapering starts and stops. If for some
    reason (last_t - first_t) is 0 then rel_t will be 1 and it is assumed the
    returned function will be called with only first_t. The returned point will
    at the origin + any xxx_offsets.
